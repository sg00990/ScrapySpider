# ScrapySpider
The ScrapySpider is a web crawler that searches for content on websites with the domain 'kennesaw.edu.'

## Usage
To run the spider, use the following command in your terminal: scrapy crawl ksu

## Results

The spider generates two tables with the following results: table1.py and table2.py.

table1.py includes stopwords while table2.py does not. Both tables contain the same information, but table1.py filters out commonly used words like "and," "the," and "is."
